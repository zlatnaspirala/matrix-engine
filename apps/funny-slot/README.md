# Note

## This folder is old visual-js game engine example. Nothing related with matrix-engine library. it is just embeded web example used for porting on 3d surface.

## Visual-Js old will be replaced (already replaced in TextureEditor).
Visual-Js3 is npm service supported, it is better solution.
