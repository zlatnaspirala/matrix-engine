Note:

This is node.js dev tools (not javascript client)! :
 - config.js
 - editor.js
 - res.js
 - build.js

Add new images to the `2DTextureEditor\res\animations`. Texture Editor (visual-js version 3) use own source directorium.
Run `npm run res.tex.editor` after adding new image. Always need to create new folder and put new image intro the folder.
After this command you will see access `RESOURCE.folderName`.

Write you code intro: `actual.js`
You can make multi instance like tex1.html/tex1.js , tex2.html/tex2.js etc...
